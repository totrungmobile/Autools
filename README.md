Note: When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:

If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.
When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.
